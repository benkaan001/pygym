# (1) Write a program to create a new string made of an input string’s first, middle, and last character.
str1 = "festive"  # fte


# (2) Write a program to create a new string made of the middle three characters of an input string.
str1 = "JaSonAy"  # Son
str1 = "JohonDipPeta"  # Dip


# (3) Given two strings, s1 and s2. Write a program to create a new string s3 by appending s2 in the middle of s1.
s1 = "Aunt"
s2 = "Kelly"  # AuKellynt


# (4) Given two strings, s1 and s2, write a program to return a new string made of s1 and s2’s first, middle, and last characters.
s1 = "America"
s2 = "Japan"  # AJrpan


# (5) Write a program to arrange the characters of a string so that all lowercase letters should come first.
str1 = "PyNaTive"  # yaivePNT


# (6) Count all letters, digits, and special symbols from a given string
# Characters=8 Digits=3 Symbols=4
str1 = "P@#yn26at^&i5ve"


# (7) Given two strings, s1 and s2. Write a program to create a new string s3
# made of the first char of s1, then the last char of s2,
# Next, the second char of s1 and second last char of s2, and so on.
# Any leftover chars go at the end of the result.
s1 = "Abc"
s2 = "Xyz"  # AzbycX


# (8) Write a program to check if two strings are balanced.
# For example, strings s1 and s2 are balanced if all the characters in the s1 are present in s2.
# The character’s position doesn’t matter.
s1 = "Yn"
s2 = "PYnative"  # True

s1 = "Ynf"
s2 = "PYnative"  # False


# (9) Write a program to find all occurrences of “USA” in a given string ignoring the case.
str1 = "Welcome to USA. usa awesome, isn't it?"  # count = 2


# (10) Given a string s1, write a program to return the sum and average of the digits
# that appear in the string, ignoring all other characters.
str1 = "PYnative29@#8496"  # Sum is: 38 Average is  6.333333333333333


# (11) Write a program to count occurrences of all characters within a string
str1 = "Apple"  # {'A': 1, 'p': 2, 'l': 1, 'e': 1}


# (12) Reverse a given string
str1 = "PYnative"   # evitanYP


# (13) Write a program to find the last position of a substring “Emma” in a given string.
str1 = "Emma is a data scientist who knows Python. Emma works at google."
# Last occurrence of Emma starts at index 43


# (14) Split a string on hyphens
str1 = "Emma-is-a-data-scientist"  # Emmaisadatascientist


# (15) Remove empty strings from a list of strings
str_list = ["Emma", "Jon", "", "Kelly", None, "Eric", ""]
# ['Emma', 'Jon', 'Kelly', 'Eric']


# (16) Remove special symbols / punctuation from a string
str1 = "/*Jon is @develo^^^per & musician&&"     # "Jon is developer musician"


# (17) Removal all characters from a string except integers
str1 = "She is 25 years and 10 months old"  # 2510
