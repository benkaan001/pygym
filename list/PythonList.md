In Python, if you attempt to perform a mathematical operation on a list, the behavior depends on the operation you're trying to execute. Here are some general behaviors:

1. **Addition (`+`) and Concatenation (`*`):**
   - Addition (`+`) is not directly supported between a list and a number.
   - Concatenation (`*`) is valid, but it repeats the list by the specified number of times.

    ```python
    # Example
    my_list = [1, 2, 3]

    # Concatenation
    result_concatenation = my_list * 3  # [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]

    # Addition (not supported)
    # result_addition = my_list + 3  # TypeError: can only concatenate list (not "int") to list
    ```

2. **Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), and Division (`/`):**
   - These operations are not directly supported between a list and a number.

    ```python
    # Example
    my_list = [1, 2, 3]

    # Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division are not supported
    # result_subtraction = my_list - 3  # TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'list' and 'int'
    # result_multiplication = my_list * 3  # TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'list'
    # result_division = my_list / 2  # TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'list' and 'int'
    ```

3. **Modulo (`%`) and Exponentiation (`**`):**
   - These operations are not directly supported between a list and a number.

    ```python
    # Example
    my_list = [1, 2, 3]

    # Modulo and Exponentiation are not supported
    # result_modulo = my_list % 2  # TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'list' and 'int'
    # result_exponentiation = my_list ** 2  # TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow(): 'list' and 'int'
    ```

## Operations Between Two Lists

In Python, operations between two lists behave differently depending on the type of operation you are performing. Here are the common list operations:

1. **Concatenation (`+`):**
   - The `+` operator concatenates two lists, creating a new list that contains all the elements from the first list followed by all the elements from the second list.

    ```python
    # Example
    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
    list2 = [4, 5, 6]

    result_concatenation = list1 + list2  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    ```

2. **Repetition (`*`):**
   - The `*` operator repeats a list by a specified number of times, creating a new list.

    ```python
    # Example
    list1 = [1, 2, 3]

    result_repetition = list1 * 3  # [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
    ```

3. **Equality (`==`) and Inequality (`!=`):**
   - Lists are considered equal if they have the same elements in the same order.

    ```python
    # Example
    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
    list2 = [1, 2, 3]
    list3 = [4, 5, 6]

    result_equality = list1 == list2  # True
    result_inequality = list1 != list3  # True
    ```

4. **Slicing (`[:]`):**
   - Slicing allows you to create a new list by extracting a portion of an existing list.

    ```python
    # Example
    original_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    result_slicing = original_list[1:4]  # [2, 3, 4]
    ```

5. **Other Operations:**
   - Other mathematical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, exponentiation) are not directly supported between two lists. If you want to perform element-wise operations, you can use list comprehensions or libraries like `numpy`.

    ```python
    # Example using list comprehension for element-wise addition
    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
    list2 = [4, 5, 6]

    result_element_wise_addition = [x + y for x, y in zip(list1, list2)]  # [5, 7, 9]
    ```
