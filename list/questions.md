## 20 Advanced Questions Focusing on Lists:

**1. Recursive List Operations:**

* Implement a function to reverse a list without using built-ins.
* Write a recursive function to flatten a nested list of arbitrary depth.
* Design a recursive function to find the sum of elements in a list.
* Implement a function to check if a list is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

**2. List Comprehensions and Generators:**

* Create a list of squares of all even numbers between 1 and 100 using list comprehension.
* Generate a list of prime numbers below 100 using a generator function.
* Use list comprehension to filter out duplicate elements from a list.
* Write a generator function to return Fibonacci sequence numbers up to a given limit.

**3. Advanced List Manipulation and Functions:**

* Implement a function to find the kth largest element in a list.
* Write a function to partition a list based on a given predicate (e.g., even/odd).
* Design a function to rotate a list by a given number of positions.
* Implement a function to merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list.

**4. Memory Efficiency and Performance:**

* Compare the memory usage and performance of using list comprehensions vs. explicit loops.
* Analyze the space and time complexity of different list operations like append, insert, and pop.
* Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using generators versus creating lists.
* Explore efficient ways to manipulate large datasets using lists and alternative data structures.

**5. Customizing List Behavior:**

* Extend the `list` class to add a custom method for calculating the mean of elements.
* Implement the `__eq__` method to compare two custom list objects by their content.
* Override the `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` methods to provide custom element access and modification.
* Discuss the challenges and considerations when extending the `list` class.

**6. Real-World Applications:**

* Design a function to analyze a log file and extract specific information using list operations.
* Develop a script to parse and manipulate data from a CSV file using lists.
* Implement a basic sorting algorithm like selection sort or bubble sort using lists.
* Explore how lists are used in common data structures like stacks and queues.

**7. Open-Ended Challenges:**

* Design a function to find the longest common subsequence of two lists.
* Implement a function to detect cycles in a linked list represented as a list of nodes.
* Create a program to solve the Sudoku puzzle using list manipulation techniques.
* Develop a text-based game that utilizes lists to store game state and data.

**8. Bonus Challenge:**

* Implement a custom list object that uses a different underlying data structure (e.g., linked list)
* Compare and contrast the performance and memory usage of your custom list with the built-in `list` class.
* Explore advanced data structures like trees and graphs that rely heavily on list-based implementations.
