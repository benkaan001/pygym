# (1) Write a program to add all its elements into a given set.
sample_set = {"Yellow", "Orange", "Black"}
sample_list = ["Blue", "Green", "Red"]
# {'Green', 'Yellow', 'Black', 'Orange', 'Red', 'Blue'}


# (2) Return a new set of identical items from two sets
set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
# {40, 50, 30}


# (3) Return a new set with unique items from both sets by removing duplicates.
set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
# {70, 40, 10, 50, 20, 60, 30}


# (4) Update the first set with items that donâ€™t exist in the second set
set1 = {10, 20, 30}
set2 = {20, 40, 50}
# set1 {10, 30}


# (5) Write a Python program to remove items 10, 20, 30 from the following set at once.
set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
# {40,50}


# (6)  Return a set of elements present in Set A or B, but not both
set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
# {20, 70, 10, 60}


# (7) Check if two sets have any elements in common. If yes, display the common elements
set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {60, 70, 80, 90, 10}
# {10}
