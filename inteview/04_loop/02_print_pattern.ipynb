    "The pattern is a triangular pattern made up of asterisks (`*`). The number of asterisks in each row corresponds to the row number. Let's break down the logic step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The outer loop (`for i in range(1, rows + 1)`) iterates over each row, where `rows` is the number of rows you want in the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inside the outer loop, there's an inner loop (`for j in range(1, i + 1)`) that iterates over each column within the current row (`i` is the row number).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inside the inner loop, we print an asterisk (`*`) for each iteration, and we use the `end=\" \"` parameter to make sure the asterisks are printed on the same line.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After the inner loop finishes printing asterisks for the current row, we use `print()` without any arguments to move to the next line. This creates the effect of moving to a new row for the next iteration of the outer loop.\n",

    "- Row 1: The outer loop's first iteration sets `i` to 1. The inner loop runs once (`j` is 1), and one asterisk is printed. After the inner loop, `print()` creates a new line.\n",

    "  *\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Row 2: The outer loop's second iteration sets `i` to 2. The inner loop runs twice (`j` is 1 and 2), and two asterisks are printed. After the inner loop, `print()` creates a new line.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  *\n",
    "  * *\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Row 3: The outer loop's third iteration sets `i` to 3. The inner loop runs three times (`j` is 1, 2, and 3), and three asterisks are printed. After the inner loop, `print()` creates a new line.\n",
