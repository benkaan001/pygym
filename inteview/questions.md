The most common interview coding questions in Python typically fall into several categories. Here are some of the most common interview coding questions in Python:

1. **String Manipulation**:
   - Reverse a string.
   - Check if a string is a palindrome.
   - Count occurrences of a character in a string.
   - Check if two strings are anagrams.
   - Compress/decompress strings.

2. **Arrays and Lists**:
   - Find the maximum or minimum element in an array/list.
   - Find the second largest/smallest element in an array/list.
   - Remove duplicates from an array/list.
   - Rotate an array/list by a given number of positions.
   - Merge two sorted arrays/lists.

3. **Recursion**:
   - Implement factorial of a number using recursion.
   - Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.
   - Recursive implementations of binary search or linear search.

4. **Linked Lists**:
   - Reverse a singly linked list.
   - Detect if there is a cycle in a linked list.
   - Merge two sorted linked lists.

5. **Trees and Graphs**:
   - Implement common tree traversal algorithms (e.g., inorder, preorder, postorder).
   - Find the height or depth of a binary tree.
   - Check if a binary tree is a binary search tree (BST).
   - Find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree.
   - Implement graph traversal algorithms (e.g., BFS, DFS).

6. **Sorting and Searching**:
   - Implement sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort).
   - Search for an element in a sorted array using binary search.

7. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Solve classic DP problems like the knapsack problem, coin change problem, etc.

8. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   - Implement classes and methods to model real-world scenarios.
   - Demonstrate inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

9. **Miscellaneous**:
   - Find the missing number in an array.
   - Find the intersection or union of two arrays.
   - Implement stack and queue data structures.
   - Solve math-related problems (e.g., prime numbers, GCD).
