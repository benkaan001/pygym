    "**Interfaces and Multiple Inheritance: Music Player**\n",
    "   - **Question:** Design classes for a simple music player system. Implement an interface `Playable` for playable items like songs and playlists. Create classes for `Song`, `Playlist`, and `Album`, ensuring proper encapsulation and demonstrating multiple inheritance.\n",
    "   - **Class Signature:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Playable:\n",
    "       @abstractmethod\n",
    "       def play(self) -> None:\n",

    "Let's break down the logic of the music player interface step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defining Music Components:**\n",
    "   You define a set of classes that represent different music components: `Song`, `Playlist`, and `Album`. These classes encapsulate the attributes and behaviors of songs, playlists, and albums.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using Inheritance:**\n",
    "   You use inheritance to establish a common base class, `MusicItem`, from which `Song`, `Playlist`, and `Album` inherit. This is a way to enforce common behavior and attributes among these classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interfaces for Common Actions:**\n",
    "   You create an interface named `Playable` with a method `play()` that represents the common action of playing music items. This interface allows you to ensure that each class that implements it provides the necessary functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism with `play()` Method:**\n",
    "   Each class (`Song`, `Playlist`, `Album`) implements the `play()` method according to its own behavior. This demonstrates polymorphism, as different classes provide their own implementation of the same method.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Demonstrating Polymorphism:**\n",
    "   You create a list of music items (`items`) that includes instances of `Song`, `Playlist`, and `Album`. Then, you iterate through this list and call the `play()` method on each item. Because of polymorphism, each item's specific `play()` implementation is invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a summary of the main points in your music player interface logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define classes for `Song`, `Playlist`, and `Album`, inheriting from a common base class (`MusicItem`).\n",
    "- Create an interface (`Playable`) with the `play()` method.\n",
    "- Implement the `play()` method in each class (`Song`, `Playlist`, `Album`) based on their specific behavior.\n",
    "- Use polymorphism to call the `play()` method on instances of different classes.\n"
