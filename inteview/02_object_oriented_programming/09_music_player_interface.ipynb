    "**Interfaces and Multiple Inheritance: Music Player**\n",
    "   - **Question:** Design classes for a simple music player system. Implement an interface `Playable` for playable items like songs and playlists. Create classes for `Song`, `Playlist`, and `Album`, ensuring proper encapsulation and demonstrating multiple inheritance.\n",
    "   - **Class Signature:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Playable:\n",
    "       @abstractmethod\n",
    "       def play(self) -> None:\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Song(Playable):\n",
    "       def __init__(self, title: str, artist: str):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "\n",
    "       def play(self) -> None:\n",

    "       def play(self) -> None:\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   song1 = Song(\"Song 1\", \"Artist A\")\n",
    "   song2 = Song(\"Song 2\", \"Artist B\")\n",
