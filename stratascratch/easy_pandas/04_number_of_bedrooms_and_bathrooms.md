## Finding Average Bedrooms & Bathrooms per Property Type (by City)

This solution calculates the average number of bedrooms and bathrooms for each unique combination of city and property type in the `airbnb_search_details` DataFrame. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

**Step 1: Group by City and Property Type**

* We use `groupby(['city', 'property_type'])` to group the DataFrame by both the 'city' and 'property_type' columns. This creates separate groups for each unique combination of city and property type.


```Python
grouped_df = airbnb_search_details.groupby(['city', 'property_type'])
```

**Step 2: Calculate Average Bedrooms & Bathrooms**

* We use `['bedrooms', 'bathrooms'].mean()` on the grouped data (`grouped_df`) to calculate the mean (average) of the 'bedrooms' and 'bathrooms' columns within each group. This results in a new DataFrame showing the average number of bedrooms and bathrooms for each city-property type combination.



```Python
grouped_df = airbnb_search_details.groupby(['city', 'property_type'])['bedrooms', 'bathrooms'].mean()
```

**Explanation:**

This step computes the average values for both 'bedrooms' and 'bathrooms' within each group defined by city and property type.

**Step 3: Reindex Grouped DataFrame (Optional)**

* We use `reset_index()` on `grouped_df` to convert the multi-level index (from grouping) into regular columns. This step is optional but can improve readability, especially when working with the DataFrame later.



```Python
reindexed_grouped_df = grouped_df.reset_index()
```

**Explanation:**

This step transforms the DataFrame structure by incorporating the grouping variables ('city' and 'property_type') as regular columns alongside the calculated averages.

**Step 4: Rename Columns for Clarity**

* We use `rename(columns={'bedrooms': 'n_bedrooms_avg', 'bathrooms': 'n_bathroom_avg'})` to rename the columns containing the averages for better clarity.



```Python
renamed_grouped_df = reindexed_grouped_df.rename(columns={'bedrooms': 'n_bedrooms_avg', 'bathrooms': 'n_bathroom_avg'})
```

**Explanation:**

This step enhances readability by assigning more descriptive names to the columns holding the average values ('n_bedrooms_avg' and 'n_bathroom_avg').

**Sample Output:**

| city        | property_type | n_bedrooms_avg | n_bathroom_avg |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| New York    | Apartment     | 1.5            | 1.2            |
| Los Angeles | House         | 3.0            | 2.5            |
| Paris       | Apartment     | 1.0            | 0.8            |
| London      | House         | 2.8            | 2.2            |

**Explanation:**

The output displays the city, property type, average number of bedrooms (`n_bedrooms_avg`), and average number of bathrooms (`n_bathroom_avg`) for each unique combination. This information can be valuable for understanding rental property trends across different city-property type categories.
