## Finding Workers by Department (April Onwards) - Using Series

This solution tackles the problem of identifying the number of workers who joined each department in or after April, sorted by department with the most workers first. Here, we'll directly work with a Pandas Series, avoiding the intermediate DataFrame conversion.

**Steps:**

1. **Filter by Joining Date (Month >= 4):**

   - We use `worker.joining_date.dt.month >= 4` to select rows where the joining month (from 'joining_date') is April (4) or later.

   ```python
   filtered_df = worker[worker.joining_date.dt.month >= 4]
   ```

2. **Group by Department and Count Workers:**

   - We use `groupby('department')` to group the `filtered_df` by the 'department' column.
   - We then use `['worker_id'].count()` on the grouped data to count the number of workers within each department group. The result is a Series containing department names as the index and worker counts as the values.

   ```python
   series = filtered_df.groupby('department')['worker_id'].count().rename('num_workers')
   ```

3. **Sort by Number of Workers (Descending):**

   - We use `sort_values(ascending=False)` to sort the Series (`series`) by the 'num_workers' values in descending order.

   ```python
   sorted_series = series.sort_values(ascending=False)
   ```

4. **Print the Sorted Series:**

   - Finally, we print the `sorted_series` to display the department names and corresponding number of workers who joined in or after April, sorted by department size (descending).

   ```python
   print(sorted_series)
   ```

**Sample Output:**

```
department
Sales           5
Admin           3
Marketing       2
dtype: int64
```

**Explanation:**

The output shows the departments along with the number of workers who joined each department since April (in descending order based on worker count). This provides insights into departmental staffing trends.

**Benefits of Using Series:**

- Potentially more efficient, especially for large datasets.
- Can be more concise for operations focused on values.

**Choosing Between Series and DataFrame:**

The choice depends on your needs. If you require more advanced DataFrame operations, convert to a DataFrame.
